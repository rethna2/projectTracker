This is developed using React and Redux ecosystem.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is learning, teaching and mentoring. There are few open source projects that are SaaS type. But most of the developers work in SaaS type applications. The students are not able to find life-size projects available as opensource and they are sceptical about the 'correct way' of doing things.

This project is not perfect yet and many features are still work in progress. So, there is lot of ground to cover before we get production ready.

## Guidelines:

### Just one app:

Most of the companies uses two different apps, one for managing projects (something like JIRA) and another for logging time. The primary goal of this project is to solve this by using project - people matrix.

### A short note on estimation points:

Estimation is measured in points (and not in hours) based on the complexity of the implementation. The time it takes to complete a task depends on the expertise of the developer. We can roughly approximate this to something like below.

- beginner = 2hrs/point
- experienced = 1 hrs/point
- expert = 0.5 hrs/point

But this is not correct for all cases. If the work is very simple, then everyone will take the same time. At the same time, if the work is very complex, the beginner may not be able to complete the task. In a way, points is a way of measuring the cost of the test
